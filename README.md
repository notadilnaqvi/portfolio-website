## A portfolio website
A personal portfolio website (adilnaqvi.com) made using React

### Known issues
* Centering divs horizontally using flex does not work in IE and pre-chromium Edge
* Misalignment of top-right header "blobs" in Safari
* Text fields on Contact page don't get custom styling on Safari
* adilnaqvi.com/resume needs better implementation
* ~~Hover-to-show links on Contact page are not intuitive on mobile~~ **[FIXED]**

### Features I want to implement
* Dark mode
* Search (with tags) on the Projects page
* Eastereggs (inspired by [maxlaumeister](https://www.maxlaumeister.com/achievements/))
* Page transitions
* Animated burger menu
